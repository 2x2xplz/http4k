## Commercial Support
We recognise that although organisations use happily Open Source Software such as **http4k**, they may gain additional peace of mind from having direct access to expert advice.

- System architecture and design review
- Testing strategy and implementation review
- Project-level Developer and Team mentoring
- On-site **http4k** talks and training
- Troubleshooting integration issues and debugging
- Kotlin language Developer training
- Advice on extending or creating custom builds of **http4k**

Please get in touch at: **[support@http4k.org](mailto:support@http4k.org)**

## General Help
- In the first instance, try and see if there is a relevant example in the cookbook or [FAQ](/faq) - more and more are being added all the time!
- For issues, please describe giving as much detail as you can - including version and steps to recreate.
- **Slack room:** #http4k @ <a href="http://slack.kotlinlang.org/">slack.kotlinlang.org</a> <-- PREFERRED
- **Gitter channel:** http4k/http4k @ <a href="https://gitter.im/http4k/http4k">gitter.im</a> 
- **Twitter:** <a href="https://twitter.com/http4k">@http4k</a>

**Note:** As a general rule, you'll get a quicker response from the Slack channel.

## Logo Usage
The **http4k** logo design and branding are copyright 2019 to the owners of http4k.org. If you'd like to use the **http4k** logo in a presentation or for other purposes, it's probably fine, but please reach out to let know first on the channels above that you'd like to do so and we can provide the relevant high-quality asset files. Here are the relevant [branding guidelines](https://logojoy.com/b/http4k).
