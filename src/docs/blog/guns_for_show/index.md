# http4k Toolbox: Guns for show, knives for a pro

Over the years of creating apps with [http4k], we've collated several tools that we use to turbo charge our development activities. With the advent of v4 of the library, and with a little time on our hands, we decided to bring all of these tools together into a single place so that all of our users could get their benefits. 

These tools are mostly based around code generation of some sort or another and are mainly used to shortcut repetitive or mundane development tasks that you might encounter when developing and testing applications with [http4k]. For development, we made extensive use of the excellent [http4k] web library (have you heard of it? it's really rather good!), as well as [KotlinPoet](https://square.github.io/kotlinpoet/) and [Bunting4k](https://github.com/fork-handles/forkhandles/tree/trunk/bunting4k), a new CLI flags library that we created for this task.

#### the web toolbox: [https://toolbox.http4k.org][Toolbox]
An obvious place to start was the web, so we created a React UI using the amazing [Material-UI](https://material.io/) components library and are deploying it to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). The main concept behind each of the functions is to allow the user to preview any generated code before they download it. We have also set up automated pipelines to update the Toolbox whenever we do a release of [http4k].

#### the CLI
The http4k team are massive fans of automation, so we also wanted to enable teams to use the functions of the Toolbox in a shell. Hence, we decided to also make a CLI agent for the Toolbox. It is available via [Brew](https://brew.sh) and [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io). You can find instructions about how to install it on the [Toolbox homepage](https://toolbox.http4k.org).

Where we introduce each of the functions of the [Toolbox], with a rationale and a bit of background on each:

##### [Generating a project ](https://toolbox.http4k.org/project).
This is quite a common one for various libraries, but they tend to be quite basic - and we thought we could do better. 

The http4k Project Generator is an intelligent questionnaire-based wizard which allows the user to select their backend, extra modules, and build system. It then crunches all of the code from these choices together into a coherent project configuration (called a "Stack"), and provides a reusable link for regenerating the same project configuration again. 

The questionnaire is dynamically generated by providing options for all of the 17+ supported Server and Serverless backends, and the further 30+ [http4k] integration modules, including examples of the different types of tests that you can write for apps. We can also add other "features" to be mixed in to the project structure.
